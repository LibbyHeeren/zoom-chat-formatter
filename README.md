# zoom-chat-formatter
Some Python functions I use to re-format Zoom chat files for enhanced readability. Input is a zoom chat .txt, output is also a .txt. It would be even better to turn them into markdown! This code is 500% a ChatGPT collaboration, so feel free to let me know if anything looks weird.
